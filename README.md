# DreamTeam_Activity_1
In this assignment, we were put into groups of 4 to make an application that
utilizes all of the technologies we've learned so far plus at least one new
technology. We were asked to use at least two APIs and to make calls to the
APIs with the Ajax method. Our app uses the FourSquare API to select a
random restaurant (or restaurants) and the Waze API to navigate to the
restaurant after one is chosen.
