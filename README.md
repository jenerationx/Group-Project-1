# Where Should We Eat?

In this project, our group created an app that helps the user choose where to go out to eat when they're having trouble deciding.  We used the FourSquare API to select a
random restaurant (or 3 random restaurants) and the Waze API to navigate to the
restaurant after one is chosen.
